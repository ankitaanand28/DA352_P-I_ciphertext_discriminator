# DA 352 course project
Our Project has two parts , first part was to train RNN to distinguish between valid ciphertexts and randomly generated ciphertexts using two encryption algorithms LFSR (Stream Cipher) and Feistel Network 2 rounds (Block Cipher) .
We used self created datasets for training and testing in LFSR and Feistel part.

The deployed models can be tested by directly running this command in the folder directory terminal.<i> (without any changes)</i>

```
python Frontend_Model_Deployed.py

```

This part was prepared by @ANKITA ANAND and @BORRA LAKSHYA.
